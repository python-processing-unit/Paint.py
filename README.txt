This is a short painting program I wrote to mimic the functionality of MS Paint, but Open-Source and with a cleaner UI.
Hit Left Arrow/Right Arrow to cycle through pre-defined colors ~~(I am working on a version with manual RGB selection).~~
Hit Up Arrow/Down Arrow to alter the size of the Tpen.
Left click to raise/lower the Tpen.
Hit S to save as a JPEG.
Make sure to place the turtle window on full screen, it should automatically match your monitors aspect ratio.
